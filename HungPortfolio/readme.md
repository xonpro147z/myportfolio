# Khoa's Portfolio Website

  This is my personal portfolio website, built with Three.js and React. You can see a live demo at [Here](khoa-portfolio-phi.vercel.app).

## How to Customize and Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DevPhamPham/KhoaPortfolio.git
  cd KhoaPortfolio 
  ```

2. Install Dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm installl
  ```

3. Personalize Your Information:

  - Edit the content in index.html to reflect your own details.

4. Replace 3D Model:

- The default model is a room. Replace the room.glb file in the public/models folder with your own GLTF/GLB model.
- You can create custom rooms using Blender or other 3D modeling software.

5. Change Background Computer's Video:

- Replace the video file in the public/textures folder with your own video.

6. Configure Paths (if needed):

- Check and update the paths to your models and textures in Experience/Utils/assets.js if you've changed their locations.

## Run project

  ```bash
    npm run dev
  ```

The project will start in development mode, and you can view it in your web browser.
